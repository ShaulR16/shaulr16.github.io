## Structure

Each Command is defined in a file in the [`_cloudcmd`] folder named as `<Provider-Service-Name_of_command>.md`, such file consists only of a [YAML] front matter which describes the command and its attributes.

The full syntax is the following:

```

```

Where `ITEM` is one of the values described in the [`_data/items.yml`] file, `SERVICE` is one of the values described in the [`_data/services.yml`] file, `OS` (Owned Position) is one of the values described in the [`_data/OS.yml`] file, `ATTACK_TYPE` is one of the values described in the [`_data/attack_types.yml`] file, and `LINK` is a link to download the related tool for that command as well as links to any other relevant information about what the command is doing.
