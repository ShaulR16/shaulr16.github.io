SkyFall is an interactive cheat sheet, containing a curated list of offensive security tools and their respective commands, to be used against Cloud environments.  

This project was inspired by [GTFOBins][GTFOBins] and [LOLBAS][LOLBAS]. I relied heavily on [GTFOBins'][GTFOBins] site template to make this one.
